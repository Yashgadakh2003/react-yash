title: No Redirect in Try-Catch Without Rethrow
---

> Ensure that when using `redirect` within a try-catch block, the catch block must start with a call to `unstable_rethrow` to ensure proper error propagation.

## Why This Error Occurred

You attempted to use the `redirect` function within a try-catch block without rethrowing the error using `unstable_rethrow`. When `redirect` is called, it throws a `NEXT_REDIRECT` error internally. If this error is caught without being rethrown, it prevents the redirect from executing as intended and suppresses the error handling.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To ensure proper error handling and that the redirect can proceed as intended, the catch block should start with a call to `unstable_rethrow`. This ensures that Next.js's internal error handling is respected and that the redirect is properly executed.

If you need to handle other errors, you can still do so after the `unstable_rethrow` call.

## Example

### Incorrect Usage:

```javascript
try {
  // some code that might throw an error
  redirect('/some-path')
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

### Correct Usage:

```javascript
try {
  // some code that might throw an error
  redirect('/some-path')
} catch (error) {
  unstable_rethrow(error)
  // handle other errors if necessary
}
```
